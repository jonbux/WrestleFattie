`[slw_product_message is_available="yes" only_location_available="no" location="location-slug"]Your custom product message/HTML here[/slw_product_message]`

= Cart page =

`[slw_cart_message qty_from_location="location-slug" only_location_available="no"]Your custom cart message/HTML here[/slw_cart_message]`

REST API endpoints (both accept `GET` and `PUT` requests):
