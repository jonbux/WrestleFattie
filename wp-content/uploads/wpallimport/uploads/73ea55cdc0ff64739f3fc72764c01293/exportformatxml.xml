 Testimonial from a Dollamur Puzzle Mat customer:
 "Before I bought my mats from Dollamur, I shopped pretty extensively getting samples from several dealers. When I ordered from Dollamur I was confident I was getting the best pad for the money. Their 1" pad was thicker than another brands's 1" pad and cheaper. My salesperson Troy gave helpful service and the process was simple. I'll be back at Dollamur when we expand into our big dream location. Our school is primarily Krav Maga and kick boxing but we also do fitness training. Every aspect of our training area has been enhanced by adding a padded floor. A+"

 Machine washable; the Dollamur mop and mop pads are the easiest way to keep your mats clean and protect athletes healthy.Washing Microfiber Correctly: 3 Things To Remember
 Good microfiber should last for years when cared for properly. Here are a few things to keep in mind when laundering them.:
 • Don't use fabric softener including detergents with softeners. Fabric softener clogs up the open spaces in the fiber that make them so effective.
 • Don't dry in your dryer on high heat. Instead, air dry or dry them in the dryer on low heat or no heat.
 • Don't wash or dry microfiber with cotton! Cotton lints and microfiber picks up and holds on to everything. Ideally you should wash microfiber only with other microfiber, but if you cant make a full load with microfiber its okay to wash it with other synthetics that don't lint.
 • Prevent Color Transfer for Black or Red towels! Wash with only like colors. Take care when using this on light surfaces with cleaning solutions that may leach dye from the fabric. For more questions about washing microfiber see below or get our printable washing instructions.]]></details>

 Testimonial from a Dollamur Puzzle Mat customer:
 "Before I bought my mats from Dollamur, I shopped pretty extensively getting samples from several dealers. When I ordered from Dollamur I was confident I was getting the best pad for the money. Their 1" pad was thicker than another brands's 1" pad and cheaper. My salesperson Troy gave helpful service and the process was simple. I'll be back at Dollamur when we expand into our big dream location. Our school is primarily Krav Maga and kick boxing but we also do fitness training. Every aspect of our training area has been enhanced by adding a padded floor. A+"

 Machine washable; the Dollamur mop and mop pads are the easiest way to keep your mats clean and protect athletes healthy.Washing Microfiber Correctly: 3 Things To Remember
 Good microfiber should last for years when cared for properly. Here are a few things to keep in mind when laundering them.:
 • Don't use fabric softener including detergents with softeners. Fabric softener clogs up the open spaces in the fiber that make them so effective.
 • Don't dry in your dryer on high heat. Instead, air dry or dry them in the dryer on low heat or no heat.
 • Don't wash or dry microfiber with cotton! Cotton lints and microfiber picks up and holds on to everything. Ideally you should wash microfiber only with other microfiber, but if you cant make a full load with microfiber its okay to wash it with other synthetics that don't lint.
 • Prevent Color Transfer for Black or Red towels! Wash with only like colors. Take care when using this on light surfaces with cleaning solutions that may leach dye from the fabric. For more questions about washing microfiber see below or get our printable washing instructions.]]></details>

 Machine washable; the Dollamur mop and mop pads are the easiest way to keep your mats clean and protect athletes healthy.Washing Microfiber Correctly: 3 Things To Remember
 Good microfiber should last for years when cared for properly. Here are a few things to keep in mind when laundering them.:
 • Don't use fabric softener including detergents with softeners. Fabric softener clogs up the open spaces in the fiber that make them so effective.
 • Don't dry in your dryer on high heat. Instead, air dry or dry them in the dryer on low heat or no heat.
 • Don't wash or dry microfiber with cotton! Cotton lints and microfiber picks up and holds on to everything. Ideally you should wash microfiber only with other microfiber, but if you cant make a full load with microfiber its okay to wash it with other synthetics that don't lint.
 • Prevent Color Transfer for Black or Red towels! Wash with only like colors. Take care when using this on light surfaces with cleaning solutions that may leach dye from the fabric. For more questions about washing microfiber see below or get our printable washing instructions.]]></details>

 Good microfiber should last for years when cared for properly. Here are a few things to keep in mind when laundering them.:
 • Don't use fabric softener including detergents with softeners. Fabric softener clogs up the open spaces in the fiber that make them so effective.
 • Don't dry in your dryer on high heat. Instead, air dry or dry them in the dryer on low heat or no heat.
 • Don't wash or dry microfiber with cotton! Cotton lints and microfiber picks up and holds on to everything. Ideally you should wash microfiber only with other microfiber, but if you cant make a full load with microfiber its okay to wash it with other synthetics that don't lint.
 • Prevent Color Transfer for Black or Red towels! Wash with only like colors. Take care when using this on light surfaces with cleaning solutions that may leach dye from the fabric. For more questions about washing microfiber see below or get our printable washing instructions.]]></details>

 Testimonial from a Dollamur Puzzle Mat customer:
 "Before I bought my mats from Dollamur, I shopped pretty extensively getting samples from several dealers. When I ordered from Dollamur I was confident I was getting the best pad for the money. Their 1" pad was thicker than another brands's 1" pad and cheaper. My salesperson Troy gave helpful service and the process was simple. I'll be back at Dollamur when we expand into our big dream location. Our school is primarily Krav Maga and kick boxing but we also do fitness training. Every aspect of our training area has been enhanced by adding a padded floor. A+"

 Testimonial from a Dollamur Puzzle Mat customer:
 "Before I bought my mats from Dollamur, I shopped pretty extensively getting samples from several dealers. When I ordered from Dollamur I was confident I was getting the best pad for the money. Their 1" pad was thicker than another brands's 1" pad and cheaper. My salesperson Troy gave helpful service and the process was simple. I'll be back at Dollamur when we expand into our big dream location. Our school is primarily Krav Maga and kick boxing but we also do fitness training. Every aspect of our training area has been enhanced by adding a padded floor. A+"

 Machine washable; the Dollamur mop and mop pads are the easiest way to keep your mats clean and protect athletes healthy.Washing Microfiber Correctly: 3 Things To Remember
 Good microfiber should last for years when cared for properly. Here are a few things to keep in mind when laundering them.:
 • Don't use fabric softener including detergents with softeners. Fabric softener clogs up the open spaces in the fiber that make them so effective.
 • Don't dry in your dryer on high heat. Instead, air dry or dry them in the dryer on low heat or no heat.
 • Don't wash or dry microfiber with cotton! Cotton lints and microfiber picks up and holds on to everything. Ideally you should wash microfiber only with other microfiber, but if you cant make a full load with microfiber its okay to wash it with other synthetics that don't lint.
 • Prevent Color Transfer for Black or Red towels! Wash with only like colors. Take care when using this on light surfaces with cleaning solutions that may leach dye from the fabric. For more questions about washing microfiber see below or get our printable washing instructions.]]></details>

 Testimonial from a Dollamur Puzzle Mat customer:
 "Before I bought my mats from Dollamur, I shopped pretty extensively getting samples from several dealers. When I ordered from Dollamur I was confident I was getting the best pad for the money. Their 1" pad was thicker than another brands's 1" pad and cheaper. My salesperson Troy gave helpful service and the process was simple. I'll be back at Dollamur when we expand into our big dream location. Our school is primarily Krav Maga and kick boxing but we also do fitness training. Every aspect of our training area has been enhanced by adding a padded floor. A+"

 Machine washable; the Dollamur mop and mop pads are the easiest way to keep your mats clean and protect athletes healthy.Washing Microfiber Correctly: 3 Things To Remember
 Good microfiber should last for years when cared for properly. Here are a few things to keep in mind when laundering them.:
 • Don't use fabric softener including detergents with softeners. Fabric softener clogs up the open spaces in the fiber that make them so effective.
 • Don't dry in your dryer on high heat. Instead, air dry or dry them in the dryer on low heat or no heat.
 • Don't wash or dry microfiber with cotton! Cotton lints and microfiber picks up and holds on to everything. Ideally you should wash microfiber only with other microfiber, but if you cant make a full load with microfiber its okay to wash it with other synthetics that don't lint.
 • Prevent Color Transfer for Black or Red towels! Wash with only like colors. Take care when using this on light surfaces with cleaning solutions that may leach dye from the fabric. For more questions about washing microfiber see below or get our printable washing instructions.]]></details>

 Testimonial from a Dollamur Puzzle Mat customer:
 "Before I bought my mats from Dollamur, I shopped pretty extensively getting samples from several dealers. When I ordered from Dollamur I was confident I was getting the best pad for the money. Their 1" pad was thicker than another brands's 1" pad and cheaper. My salesperson Troy gave helpful service and the process was simple. I'll be back at Dollamur when we expand into our big dream location. Our school is primarily Krav Maga and kick boxing but we also do fitness training. Every aspect of our training area has been enhanced by adding a padded floor. A+"

 Testimonial from a Dollamur Puzzle Mat customer:
 "Before I bought my mats from Dollamur, I shopped pretty extensively getting samples from several dealers. When I ordered from Dollamur I was confident I was getting the best pad for the money. Their 1" pad was thicker than another brands's 1" pad and cheaper. My salesperson Troy gave helpful service and the process was simple. I'll be back at Dollamur when we expand into our big dream location. Our school is primarily Krav Maga and kick boxing but we also do fitness training. Every aspect of our training area has been enhanced by adding a padded floor. A+"
