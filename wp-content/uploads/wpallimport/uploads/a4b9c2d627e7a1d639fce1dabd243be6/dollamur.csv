Here are a few things to keep in mind when laundering them.: • Don't use fabric softener including detergents with softeners. Fabric softener clogs up the open spaces in the fiber that make them so effective. • Don't dry in your dryer on high heat. Instead, air dry or dry them in the dryer on low heat or no heat. • Don't wash or dry microfiber with cotton! Cotton lints and microfiber picks up and holds on to everything. Ideally you should wash microfiber only with other microfiber, but if you cant make a full load with microfiber its okay to wash it with other synthetics that don't lint. • Prevent Color Transfer for Black or Red towels! Wash with only like colors. Take care when using this on light surfaces with cleaning solutions that may leach dye from the fabric. For more questions about washing microfiber see below or get our printable washing instructions.","Dollamur Limited Warranty - Revised 12/2017 Dollamur Sport Surfaces (“Dollamur”) offers a limited warranty on all of its products (“Dollamur Warranty”).

Here are a few things to keep in mind when laundering them.: • Don't use fabric softener including detergents with softeners. Fabric softener clogs up the open spaces in the fiber that make them so effective. • Don't dry in your dryer on high heat. Instead, air dry or dry them in the dryer on low heat or no heat. • Don't wash or dry microfiber with cotton! Cotton lints and microfiber picks up and holds on to everything. Ideally you should wash microfiber only with other microfiber, but if you cant make a full load with microfiber its okay to wash it with other synthetics that don't lint. • Prevent Color Transfer for Black or Red towels! Wash with only like colors. Take care when using this on light surfaces with cleaning solutions that may leach dye from the fabric. For more questions about washing microfiber see below or get our printable washing instructions.","Dollamur Limited Warranty - Revised 12/2017 Dollamur Sport Surfaces (“Dollamur”) offers a limited warranty on all of its products (“Dollamur Warranty”).

Here are a few things to keep in mind when laundering them.: • Don't use fabric softener including detergents with softeners. Fabric softener clogs up the open spaces in the fiber that make them so effective. • Don't dry in your dryer on high heat. Instead, air dry or dry them in the dryer on low heat or no heat. • Don't wash or dry microfiber with cotton! Cotton lints and microfiber picks up and holds on to everything. Ideally you should wash microfiber only with other microfiber, but if you cant make a full load with microfiber its okay to wash it with other synthetics that don't lint. • Prevent Color Transfer for Black or Red towels! Wash with only like colors. Take care when using this on light surfaces with cleaning solutions that may leach dye from the fabric. For more questions about washing microfiber see below or get our printable washing instructions.","Dollamur Limited Warranty - Revised 12/2017 Dollamur Sport Surfaces (“Dollamur”) offers a limited warranty on all of its products (“Dollamur Warranty”).

Here are a few things to keep in mind when laundering them.: • Don't use fabric softener including detergents with softeners. Fabric softener clogs up the open spaces in the fiber that make them so effective. • Don't dry in your dryer on high heat. Instead, air dry or dry them in the dryer on low heat or no heat. • Don't wash or dry microfiber with cotton! Cotton lints and microfiber picks up and holds on to everything. Ideally you should wash microfiber only with other microfiber, but if you cant make a full load with microfiber its okay to wash it with other synthetics that don't lint. • Prevent Color Transfer for Black or Red towels! Wash with only like colors. Take care when using this on light surfaces with cleaning solutions that may leach dye from the fabric. For more questions about washing microfiber see below or get our printable washing instructions.","Dollamur Limited Warranty - Revised 12/2017 Dollamur Sport Surfaces (“Dollamur”) offers a limited warranty on all of its products (“Dollamur Warranty”).
